							      <h2>General Information about Hannibal</h2>
								    <p>Located on the bank of the Mississippi River lies historic Hannibal, Missouri. Approximately 100 miles Northwest of St. Louis, Hannibal is one of Missouri&apos;s best tourism destinations. As the boyhood home to author Mark Twain, Hannibal is famously known as the setting for timeless novels including The Adventures of Tom Sawyer and Adventures of Huckleberry Finn. With a plethora of things to do in Hannibal, this river town is the perfect destination for a fun-filled weekend getaway or a full week of history and adventure. </p>

								    <h2>My Experience</h2>
								    <p>The weekend before Memorial Day 2009, MJ, CY and I had a tour of Mark Twain Boyhood Home and Museum in Hannibal, a small Missouri town.</p>
								    <p>I never fell madly in love with literature. I finished reading few literary masterpieces in the traditional sense. They could be counted on the fingers of two hands, if not one. None of those fingers are allocated for Mark Twain&apos;s most noted works "Adventures of Huckleberry Finn" and "the Adventures of Tom Sawyer". But thanks to the language lessons in high school, every student learnt about Mark Twain among other masters. His "Million Pound Note" and "Running for Governor" were quite absorbing, even to me who then wallowed in love stories.
Speaking of high school, I recall our language teacher used to insert one or two interesting and tricky questions, similar to brain quiz, in our monthly or quarterly tests. One of them was about Mark Twain: Mark Twain talked to a reporter at a cocktail party "Some congressmen are sons of bitches". Conceivably he was under fire after such a strikingly bold speech and was required to apologize. Finally he revised it by adding one word but stuck to his original intent. How did he get there? Yes, as you may know, he added "NOT" so the sentence went like "Some congressmen are NOT sons of bitches!" It might be just a joke, but why not believe? It is in line with Mark Twain&apos;s style, a mixture of wit, humor and satire, having anti-Congress arguments down to a fine art.
</p>
                    <p>Mark Twain was hailed as "Father of American Literature". It&apos;s undeniable that the adventures he experienced shaped his life, colored his writings, and partly accounted for his success. He was once a steamboat pilot on the Mississippi River among other occupations. In fact, that experience on the river was the inspiration for his pen name (real name Samuel Langhorne Clemens). In his days, a leadline was used to determine water depth. Among other marks on the leadline, Mark One means 6 feet, and Mark Twain means 12 feet. The latter was a frequent call of the leadsman and indicated safe water for sailing. That&apos;s a gain in knowledge from this tour, but not the only one&hellip;
</p>
                    <p>Before wrapping up the trip, we entered SUBWAY to grab a bite to eat. When it was my turn, I blurted out " I&apos;d like white bread, six feet, chicken teriyaki!"  "You mean&hellip;six inches," murmured the attendant. Oh, my! No wonder several other guests nearby raised their head up from the tray and look at me, weirdly. In what circumstance you wanna dig a hole and hide in? That&apos;s it. Anyway, finally I got my Six-Inch sandwich. But since then CY and MJ dubbed me "Mark One":(.</p>
